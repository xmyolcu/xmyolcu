**`Lifelong Coder (Developer/Engineering Student/Girl in STEM Digital Creator)`**

Hello! I am an explorer navigating the backend world, embarking on an adventurous journey into the depths of cloud technology. Continuous research, discovering and learning about new technologies are ingrained in my DNA. For me, coding is not just a job; it's also a form of art.

Sharing knowledge and contributing to the community are top priorities for me. In every learning experience, I enjoy sharing my new discoveries and solutions with fellow developers. Because true beauty emerges as we multiply and share knowledge.

Wishing you endless days filled with code!

 <summary><h3>💃🏻 Mer's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I didn't know what software meant until I learned about coding on my computer, which was watching normal Netflix. My brain exploded when I learned about coding, and I wish I had learned it when I was 3 years old.

My love for TBBT and Sheldon Cooper actually opened the doors to a new career for me in 2022, when I came across a TV server that was very similar to Sheldon Cooper. It didn't take long, but while searching for the company that the server belonged to, we found a job posting for a PHP Developer. Luckily, the developer was actually writing code. During those crazy times when I couldn't even use the keyboard, I was asking questions like what is software and what is a computer. I was constantly surrounded by good people who guided me in the right direction (the debate about whether becoming a backend developer is the right path), and by the beginning of 2022 September, I was opening an IDE and learning where the shift and delete keys were, and I started writing endpoints.

Then came the crying, sleeping in the living room at night, and the months of feeling deprived, followed by the process of writing code like crazy. As a result, today I am a Computer Engineering student at a university. I'm actually in the preparatory class, but I think this is also part of my journey and a new beginning somewhere.
